Expected Learning Points and Teaching Goals: 
1.	Alveolar Ventilation: The student should recognize that ventilation is inadequate, ideally by explaining that the high PaCO₂ indicates poor ventilation. 
2.	Cause of Hypoxemia: The student should identify hypoventilation as the main cause of hypoxemia, potentially noting that the alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient isn’t changed, which supports a ventilation-related cause rather than a gas exchange defect. 
(Students could also calculate the A-a gradient if relevant: PAO₂ ≈ 75 mm Hg, while PaO₂ = 65 mm Hg)
